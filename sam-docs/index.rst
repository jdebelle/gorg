gorg - Digital Document Manager
================================================

Gorg is a digital document management software that is designed
to help organise and retrieve files and folders from within large
file structures. It can be used to tag files and provide easy to 
search titles and descriptions. Gorg relies on the user providing 
information about the file so that it can efficiently be retrieved
at a later date, without needing to interpret the contents of each
file within the filetree.

Why Use Gorg?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you've ever tried to find a file from 3 years back, you likely went straight 
to your email inbox and used the search functionality there.
Because emails have a subject and a message, they make for an awesome searchable
medium. Gorg is built on the principle that files and folders that are worth keeping
should, at the very least, have a title and a description, making it significantly
easier to find what you are looking for, even years later.

Alternatively, you may have attempted to organize your files in a folder structure
on your PC. However, as time progresses, you likely needed to reorganize the folder
structure a number of times to meet new needs and demands. This constant reorganisation
process has likely made your folder structure messy and hard to go through for any
file that was part of a different structure. The same way the World-Wide-Web does away
with the underlying network structure, gorg does away with how you structure your
folders to make files searchable and easy to find.


Guiding principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gorg works on the following principles to ensure that you will
always have access to your files:

* Your files belong to you: Gorg doesn't need a server to run, it can be used \
      within your existing file system, with google drive or any mountable media.
* Your assets need to be accessible without Gorg: Gorg generates an index that you can \
      view with almost any browser, making your files as accessible as possible, to \
      anyone who has access to them.
