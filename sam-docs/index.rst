SAM - Simple Asset Manager
================================================

SAM is a simple asset management software that is designed
to help organise and retrieve files and folders from within large
file structures. It can be used to tag files and provide easy to 
search titles and descriptions. SAM relies on the user providing 
information about the file so that it can efficiently be retrieved
at a later date, without needing to interpret the contents of each
file within the filetree.

SAM works on the following principles to ensure that you will
always have access to your files:

* You should own your data.
* Your asset manager should be independant from your storage medium.
* Managed assets should be viewable, even without SAM installed.
