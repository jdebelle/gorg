Why Use Gorg?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you've ever tried to find a file from 3 years back, you likely went straight 
to your email inbox and used the search functionality there.
Because emails have a subject and a message, they make for an awesome searchable
medium. Gorg is built on the principle that files and folders that are worth keeping
should, at the very least, have a title and a description, making it significantly
easier to find what you are looking for, even years later.

Alternatively, you may have attempted to organize your files in a folder structure
on your PC. However, as time progresses, you likely needed to reorganize the folder
structure a number of times to meet new needs and demands. This constant reorganisation
process has likely made your folder structure messy and hard to go through for any
file that was part of a different structure. The same way the World-Wide-Web does away
with the underlying network structure, gorg does away with how you structure your
folders to make files searchable and easy to find.
