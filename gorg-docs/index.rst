gorg - Digital Document Manager
================================================

Gorg is a digital document management software that is designed
to help organise and retrieve files and folders from within large
file structures. It can be used to tag files and provide easy to 
search titles and descriptions. Gorg relies on the user providing 
information about the file so that it can efficiently be retrieved
at a later date, without needing to interpret the contents of each
file within the filetree.


Guiding principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gorg works on the following principles to ensure that you will
always have access to your files:

* Your files belong to you: Gorg doesn't need a server to run, it can be used \
      within your existing file system, with google drive or any mountable media.
* Your assets need to be accessible without Gorg: Gorg generates an index that you can \
      view with almost any browser, making your files as accessible as possible, to \
      anyone who has access to them.
